# KantoNET

Image classification machine learning model that can classify one of the original 151 pokemon. The model was implemented using the convolutional neural network VGG16 architecture on a dataset of 22,000 pokemon images.

## Getting Started

Thanks to JupyterNotebook & Google Colab, you can follow along the 'Kanto_NET(v1).ipynb' and the dependecies and my notes are there. The only thing you need is a kaggle.json token that you can get from your account page in Kaggle.

I might go back an clean up the document and make better markdown sections, but throughout are my lovely green comments for now.

You should be able to run the file from the top cell down to the end. I added extra dependecies imports for some cells for testing / swapping between CPU/GPU.
